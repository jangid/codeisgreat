This is my /*own*/ personal space. Followâ€”oops! I mean, bookmark this
page and check back every once in a while to see what I'm currently
working on. Forgive me if I sound self-absorbed, but honestly, no
other place on the web feels as comfortable to me for writing. Perhaps
that's because I don't have easy access everywhere to my essential
writing toolbox - /*Emacs*/. Plus, I might actually be protecting
/*your*/ privacy in the process. ðŸ˜Ž

Ever wondered why so many designers nowadays prefer using ~hsl()~
instead of ~rgb()~ for defining colors in CSS? I've explored this
topic in detail and here's my take on it.

If you develop apps for the Atlassian Marketplace, you've probably
come across requirements related to performance and scalability
testing. We recently received such a notice too.

Initially, I wasn't sure where to begin, but quickly discovered that
Atlassian has extensive documentation outlining this process clearly
and helpfully. In fact, by following their guidelines carefully,
you'll navigate the entire process smoothly.

I documented my journey here to share my personal experience. Consider
these detailed notes; they'll also help remind me exactly how to
perform these tests efficiently in the future. I hope you find them
helpful too.

While browsing through the ~etc/NEWS~ file in the latest Emacs source
code, I came across a particularly useful feature: Emacs now has a
built-in EUDC backend for MacOS contacts! My online contact list is
synced with macOS Contacts via ~CardDav~, and, with this discovery,
Emacs integrates seamlessly as well.
