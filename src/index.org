This is my /*own*/ space. Follow ... oops! ... bookmark this page and check once in a while to see what is happening in my life. Sorry if I sould like a self-obsessed person. But I don't have any other way to protect /your/ privacy. This is the only page where I can share my whereabouts without you being tracked. Also this page is /usually/ more current than my [[https://twitter.com/codeisgreat][twitter]] timeline. If you have any comments or got a suggestion for me or you just want to say hello to me then write an email at my.firstname@domain.of.this.web.site.

  Good thing is that it is based on an open-sourced project [[https://github.com/google/mediapipe][MediaPipe]] by Google. This uses WebAssembly to speedup in-browser execution. And it looks like that Google is really into it. Google is into everything BTW. They have released Chrome 84 that supports WebAssembly [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD][SIMD]] as well, claiming 2x performance boost.

  MobileNetV3 diagram is cool. The encoder and decoder are symmetric in this network. The post shares some example gifs to give you an idea. Honestly shares where it lacks. Look at the last gif. It clearly shows edge problems. But this is will definitely improve overtime. Great work.

  This is a nice write-up on product launch journey. So many people think that it is a small thing to just try out and fail. No. Even if you are building a small /thing/, it is going to take some time. It is difficult to keep the hope alive. And the ones who do it, they really make it /big/.

  This arcticle clarifies why you are not seeing and perhaps won't see Kubernetes in any stable version of Debian in the near future. Debian Technical Committee (TC) will have to either change rules if they want it to bring into Debian Stable /or/ they may just keep Kubernetes in the Debian Testing repository, where they don't have any hard commitment towards security.

  Working on a tiny hello-world kind-of appication for learning something. But I don't want to re-implement authentication part. This has been done a million times by so many programmers. So I pulled a [[https://hub.docker.com/r/jboss/keycloak][Keycloak]] image from the Docker Hub. And spawned it. Great work indeed.

  But how can I just sit and watch it work. As always. Lost in the web. First [[https://www.keycloak.org/documentation][Keycloak docs]] → [[https://openid.net/connect/][OpenID]] → [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749][OAuth]].
