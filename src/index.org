* New writeup [[file:writings.html][(full list]])
** [[file:notes/emacs-macos-contacts.html][MacOS Contacts in Emacs]]

   I was browsing the =etc/NEWS= file from the latest emacs source
   code and found this useful feature. Currently my work requires me
   to work on macOS so this is kind of essential for me to fetch
   contacts into =Gnus=. Because that is what I use for all my emails
   and news.
   
   Now that it is a builtin feature, no need for any extra package for
   email address management and autocompletion. My online contacts book
   is connected to macOS contacts via =CardDav= and now =Emacs= is also
   connected to that.

   I have participated in so many fruitless debates on
   "why-linux-is-better". To get a better hand on it, I started
   reading this article from 2014. Although, I still don’t have a
   better way to win debates, but the article is definitely a must
   read. The author of this article has collected a lot of information
   that is really useful if you want to advocate the use of GNU/Linux.

   Generic statements like "Linux is more stable and reliable" are
   still part of my discussions but honestly I can not prove it on the
   spot. Do write to me if you have a better way.

   "Wikipedia is a proof that you can trust people, most of the time",
   a friend of mine always says this. This is a profound statement.

   Good thing is that it is based on an open-sourced project [[https://github.com/google/mediapipe][MediaPipe]]
   by Google. This uses WebAssembly to speedup in-browser
   execution. And it looks like that Google is really into it. Google
   is into everything BTW. They have released Chrome 84 that supports
   WebAssembly [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD][SIMD]] as well, claiming 2x performance boost.

   MobileNetV3 diagram is cool. The encoder and decoder are symmetric
   in this network. The post shares some example gifs to give you an
   idea. Honestly shares where it lacks. Look at the last gif. It
   clearly shows edge problems. But this is will definitely improve
   overtime. Great work.

   This is a nice write-up on product launch journey. So many people
   think that it is a small thing to just try out and fail. No. Even if
   you are building a small /thing/, it is going to take some time. It
   is difficult to keep the hope alive. And the ones who do it, they
   really make it /big/.

   This arcticle clarifies why you are not seeing and perhaps won't see
   Kubernetes in any stable version of Debian in the near
   future. Debian Technical Committee (TC) will have to either change
   rules if they want it to bring into Debian Stable /or/ they may just
   keep Kubernetes in the Debian Testing repository, where they don't
   have any hard commitment towards security.

   Working on a tiny hello-world kind-of appication for learning
   something. But I don't want to re-implement authentication
   part. This has been done a million times by so many programmers. So
   I pulled a [[https://hub.docker.com/r/jboss/keycloak][Keycloak]] image from the Docker Hub. And spawned it. Great
   work indeed.

   But how can I just sit and watch it work. As always. Lost in the
   web. First [[https://www.keycloak.org/documentation][Keycloak docs]] → [[https://openid.net/connect/][OpenID]] → [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749][OAuth]].
