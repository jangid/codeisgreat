    This is a nice write-up on product launch journey. So many people think that it is a small thing to just try out and fail. No. Even if you are building a small /thing/, it is going to take some time. It is difficult to keep the hope alive. And the ones who do it, they really make it /big/.

    This arcticle clarifies why you are not seeing and perhaps won't see Kubernetes in any stable version of Debian in the near future.
