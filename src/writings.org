** [[file:notes/emacs-macos-contacts.html][MacOS Contacts in Emacs]]

   I was browsing the =etc/NEWS= file from the latest emacs source
   code and found this useful feature. Currently my work requires me
   to work on macOS so this is kind of essential for me to fetch
   contacts into =Gnus=. Because that is what I use for all my emails
   and news.

   Now that it is a builtin feature, no need for any extra package for
   email address management and autocompletion. My online contacts
   book is connected to macOS contacts via =CardDav= and now =Emacs=
   is also connected to that.
