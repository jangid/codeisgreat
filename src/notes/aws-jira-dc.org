If you have an app listed on Atlassian Marketplace then you might have
come across this regulatory requirement from Atlassian that the
application must perform as per the criteria set by
Atlassian[fn:1]. We have two apps on the marketplace - (1) RMsis -
Requirement Management for Jira[fn:2] (2) LXP - Links Explorer
Traceability & Hierarchy[fn:3]. Both of them are available for Jira
Server and Jira Data Center editions. LXP is available on cloud as
well. In this article, I'll enumerate the steps to carry out the
performance tests. This exercise should be useful to me as well as
others. Because the activity needs to be conducted from time to time
to remain active on the Atlassian Marketplace.
