Following code in your startup file will enable macOS contacts access
via built-in EUDC feature of Emacs. No need for any extra package for
this. The below snippet will add a keyboard short-cut as well ~‘C-c
TAB’~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(when (eq system-type 'darwin)
  (eval-and-compile (require 'eudcb-macos-contacts))
  (eudc-macos-contacts-set-server "localhost"))
(eval-when-compile (require 'message))
(define-key message-mode-map
  [(control ?c) (tab)] 'eudc-expand-inline)
(eval-when-compile (require 'sendmail))
(define-key mail-mode-map
  [(control ?c) (tab)] 'eudc-expand-inline)
#+end_src

So if you are in a message buffer address field, just type few
characters to search and then press the above defined key sequence
~‘C-c TAB’~. If multiple matching contacts are found then the
completion system will come into play. Icomplete also works with it.

Another 0.1 sec saved in loading time. ~‘esup’~ now shows
1.497sec. Because this is all builtin.
