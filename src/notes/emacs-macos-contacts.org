#+TITLE: MacOS Contacts in Emacs
#+SUBTITLE: (Note that this works only on emacs-28, which is not yet released)
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil, num:nil, html-postamble:nil, 
#+HTML_HEAD: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../css/main.css" />

Following code in your startup file will enable macOS contacts access
via built-in EUDC feature of Emacs. No need for any extra package for
this. The below snippet will add a keyboard short-cut as well ~‘C-c
TAB’~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (when (eq system-type 'darwin)
    (eval-and-compile (require 'eudcb-macos-contacts))
    (eudc-macos-contacts-set-server "localhost"))
  (eval-when-compile (require 'message))
  (define-key message-mode-map
    [(control ?c) (tab)] 'eudc-expand-inline)
  (eval-when-compile (require 'sendmail))
  (define-key mail-mode-map
    [(control ?c) (tab)] 'eudc-expand-inline)
#+end_src

So if you are in a message buffer address field, just type few
characters to search and then press the above defined key sequence
~‘C-c TAB’~. If multiple matching contacts are found then the
completion system will come into play. Icomplete also works with it.

Another 0.1 sec saved in loading time. ~‘esup’~ now shows
1.497sec. Because this is all builtin.
